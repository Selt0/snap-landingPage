This is a solution to the [Intro section with dropdown navigation challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://selt0.github.io/snap-landingPage/](https://selt0.github.io/snap-landingPage/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As I continue to build more projects using Bootstrap, I am getting more comfortable with using it as a template and making specific custom changes such as coloring or border radius.

### Continued development

At first I wanted to build this site using my own CSS and HTML, but I can't argue with how quick and easy it was to do it with bootstrap. I mean the whole point of these tools is to make production easier, right? I feel guilty for using these tools though. It would've taken me a lot longer to finish the project as I would've had to build the mobile navigation myself. I'm not sure if I should continue dishing out projects with speed to fill up my portfolio or if I should take my time and build these sites from scratch.
